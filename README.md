# JavaScript Custom HTML Cursor Chart

![JavaScript Custom HTML Cursor Chart](CustomHTMLCursor-darkGold.png)

This demo application belongs to the set of examples for LightningChart JS, data visualization library for JavaScript.

LightningChart JS is entirely GPU accelerated and performance optimized charting library for presenting massive amounts of data. It offers an easy way of creating sophisticated and interactive charts and adding them to your website or web application.

The demo can be used as an example or a seed project. Local execution requires the following steps:

-   Make sure that relevant version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) is installed
-   Open the project folder in a terminal:

          npm install              # fetches dependencies
          npm start                # builds an application and starts the development server

-   The application is available at _http://localhost:8080_ in your browser, webpack-dev-server provides hot reload functionality.


## Description

This example serves as an example for creating a custom cursor for XY charts.

Custom cursors can be required for different purposes - like major structural changes or very application specific styling requirements.

If lesser changes to default cursors are required then please see read about different methods of configuring cursor behavior - `ChartXY` API reference has good links and explanations to follow.

Custom cursors are most importantly based on `LCJS` methods that allow solving nearest data points in series from any supplied location.
Custom user interactions and data point solving require solid understanding of different coordinate systems in web and `LCJS`, which is the primary reason this example exists;

```javascript
// Add custom action when user moves mouse over series area.
chart.onSeriesBackgroundMouseMove((_, event) => {
    // `event` is a native JavaScript event, which packs the active mouse location in `clientX` and `clientY` properties.
    const mouseLocationClient = { x: event.clientX, y: event.clientY }

    // Before using client coordinates with LCJS, the coordinates have to be translated relative to the LCJS engine.
    const mouseLocationEngine = chart.engine.clientLocation2Engine(mouseLocationClient.x, mouseLocationClient.y)

    // Now that the coordinates are in the correct coordinate system, they can be used
    // to solve data points, or further translated to any Axis.

    // (1) Translate mouse location an Axis.
    const mouseLocationAxis = translatePoint(
        mouseLocationEngine,
        // Source coordinate system.
        chart.engine.scale,
        // Target coordinate system.
        series[0].scale,
    )

    // (2) Solve nearest data point from a series to the mouse.
    const nearestDataPoint = series.solveNearestFromScreen(mouseLocationEngine)
    // `nearestDataPoint` is either `undefined`, or an object
    // which contains a collection of information about the solved data point.
})
```

In this example, the custom cursor visual is created with dynamically injected `HTML` and `CSS`.

**The same approach could be used for interacting with any UI framework**, idea being that `LCJS` is used for solving the data point and translating the location to the document, where any `HTML` element can be absolute positioned with `left` & `top` style.

The location and visibility of result table is animated with a `CSS` transition.
